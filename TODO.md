I need to create classes:

* Gsod: for anything related to downloading and extracting from the ftp. Will return Isd and Op objects
* Isd: to load and parse the ISD, to find the closest weather station
*Â Op: to extract, and parse the *op files

* Need to modify the Gsod loading functions to get an argument, for USAF-WBAN, and to have it directly extract the data
